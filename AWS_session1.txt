This is my AWS Documentatin file.
#####################
Session1: basic commands: curl and wget etc...
Creation of aws account.
For nat gateway it will be charged.
Basics of linux:
Use amazon linux..
Simple linux commands:
cd / will take to root
check linux directory structure
ls -al will show the permission or you can use ll also..
. means in current folder

Man rm
Ll|grep –I testfolder
Cat /etc/sessopn/pwd | grep –i ec2-user
To get line number:
Cat /testfolder1/file1 | grep –i –n test
cat /etc/passwd
cat /etc/passwd| grep -i ec2-user
Apt-get used in ubunto
Chmod for changing file per
Chown for changing owner permissions
Find a file in directory – ude find command
To find content in a file use grep
basic editors : for creating file use touch
nano,vi orvim...
to find a file use find
grep will be enhanced search you can go inside the file and search
locate -i *hello*
sometimes all commands wont work in linux you need to install using yum
yum is a package manager to install software
rHEL,centos,Amazon,ubuntu,suse.....linux flavours
echo "AWS class" --- used for debuging
example  program: vi whoami.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running the script now..."
echo $(whoami)
echo "script executed successfully||"
mv whoami.sh /tmp/
chmod 700 /tmp/whoami.sh
cd /tmp/
./whoami.sh
using df you can find free space -- df -h
using du you can check disk usage for indivudual  file or folder-- du -h
tar is used to archive a file(you can combine 10 files into one file)

Permission numbers are:

0 = ---
1 = --x
2 = -w-
3 = -wx
4 = r-
5 = r-x
6 = rw-
7 = rwx

read - 4,write - 2,execute - 1
owner, owner group, others

chown root(user):root(group) file1
Hostname: server name of your linux server
in windows we use ping to test the communication..

Session2:

aws data center explanation:

hp dl380 g10 —physical server(contain cpu,ram ,etc)
data center>rack>physical server 1,physical server2..

physical server>contains Hypervisor installed(you will install example——vmware vsphare,hyper-v,rhel)

rhel>contains virtual machines  web,app etc..
getrics are running inside

one region contains multiple AZ for example N. vergina contains 6 regions
edge locations: small pint of presence

1.	Ip Addressing and subnetting:
10.1.0.0/16==> vpc

10.1.1.0/24
CCNA?
managed by IANA
size of ipv4 is 32 bit==> 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
ipv6 is 128 bit
private its are used internally
public ips 
roc 1918

loopback :127.0.0.1
169.x.x.x==> metadata
Subletting:
#############################
VPC:
public cloud and private cloud
there is a security breech in public cloud
availability zone is a datacenter —AZ-US-EAST-1A
datacenter contains 100s of servers
infrastructure.aws


what are the changlances with public cloud and how vpc will solve it
there is a security breech in public cloud
how vpc works
lets deploy the vpc

problems with public cloud :

1.all the servers will be reachable to each other i.e. security breech
2.ip overlapping problem
